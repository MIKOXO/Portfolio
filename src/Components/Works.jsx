          Throughout my journey as a front-end web developer, Iâ€™ve had the
          opportunity to work on various projects, each helping me sharpen my
          skills and explore new technologies. Each of these projects has
          allowed me to solve real-world problems, work with responsive design
          principles, and apply best practices in web development. I'm always
          excited to take on new challenges and contribute to building
          innovative web solutions. Below are some of the projects that best
          reflect my ability to design and develop functional, responsive, and
          visually appealing websites.
